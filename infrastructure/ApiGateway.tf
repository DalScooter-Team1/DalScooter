# This file serves as the main entry point for API Gateway configuration.
# The actual resources are defined in separate files for better organization:

# - api_gateway_register.tf: Registration endpoint configuration
# - api_gateway_admin.tf: Admin endpoint configuration  
# - api_gateway_authorizers.tf: Authorizer and IAM role configurations
#
# All original functionality is preserved across these files.
