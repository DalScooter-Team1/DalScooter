--> For running the terraform script, Intiate your own provider for the AWS with the access_key and secret_key.
--> After the infra is done, script will log the api gateway URL pass it to the frontend with the name "VITE_SERVER"
--> Also, in the frontend pass following envs, "VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID", "VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID"
